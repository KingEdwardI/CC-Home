        <h2> Some Stuff About Me </h2>
        <p> I went to Mandeville High school in Mandeville, Louisiana and graduated in 2014. That summer, I moved to colorado with my family and proceeded to attend UCCS. It wasnt for me, and I moved back to denver to work for a while. I worked at an arbory business called A Touch of Class Tree Service in Denver for a year, while taking a small amount of classes at Red Rocks Community College. After the arbory job and the classes at Red Rocks became too easy for me, I heard about CodeCraft and am now attending. </p>
