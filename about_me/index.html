        <h3> My Pets </h3>
        <img src="08-03-2013.jpg" height="480" width="360" alt="Me with a Rainbow Boa">
        <p> I used to have a pretty cool <em>rainbow boa for a pet.</em> <br>
        I had to give it away when I moved to Colorado two years ago. <br>
        He was pretty cool, but he didn't do much except scare people, which
        was pretty funny at times. I didn't have him for long, but my friend<br>
        convinced me to get him, and I enjoyed his company for a couple years.
        </p>
        <p> My first pet was a dog named Brownie, who I believe we gave away, but I don't remember because I was so young. <br>
        I also had a cat named Hope, for at least 10 years before she died peacefully as a very old kitty. As sad as it was, she lived a full life. </p>

        <h3> My Programming Experience </h3>
        <p> I started learning HTML in eighth grade when I took a computer science class. It taught me a lot about how to structure the code properly and in a way that is easily legible. </p>
        <p> My proudest achievement was <strong>The Game of Nim</strong>. It was a simple game, that I was able to build from scratch and improve upon by adding selection options as well as an easy and hard mode. The user played against the computer and was able to choose the mode. If I could make any improvements, it would be the capability for more players.</p>
        <ul> 
            <li> <strong>Languages I have experience with:</strong> </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Python </li>
                <li> HTML </li>
                <li> CSS </li>
                <li> Java </li>
                <li> Javascript </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> I've spent the last few months working with linux systems. The first few weeks I spent most of my time installing and reinstalling different distributions either because I didn't like it or because I tried to do something and accidentally broke something that I didn't know how to fix.</p>

                    <li>Can be customized, but doesn't need to be.</li>
