Idea for the App
    King of the Server

API endpoints - what are the places we can visit
    GET /
        Main Page
    POST /
        api/click
            post clicks for yourself
//        api/register
//            register a new user
//        api/login
//            log into the server

DB Schema
    What do we need to store in the DB to make the app work

    User:
        _id
        clickCount
//        username
//        password
